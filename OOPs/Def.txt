Oops is a fundamental concept of java programming because it allow the developers to structure the code using class 
and objects, making it more modular, resuable and scalable.

The core idea of Oops is to blind the data and function that operate on it, preventing unauthorised access from other
parts of the code.

Oops have four main pillars :-
    1. Abstraction
    2. encapsulation
    3. Inheritance
    4. Polymorphism
