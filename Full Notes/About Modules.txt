Java is a programming suite --> provides all fecilities to biuld n no applications.
 ========= 3 modules ==============
	a) JSE 
	b) JEE
	c) JME

==========JSE (Java Standard Edition)
=> it is installable s/w as jdk
=> version of java =? and jdk =?
=> this id used to develop stand-alone and an applet

======= JEE (Java Enterprises Edition)
=> it is not installable s/w as jdk
=> we can develop enterprise application(web apps / distributed apps)

🌐 1. What are Web Applications in Java EE?
Web Apps are applications that run on a web server and are accessed via a browser.(client app s/w

✅ Key Features:
Built using Servlets, JSP, and JSF.

Deployed in a web container (like Apache Tomcat).

Uses HTTP protocol.

Focus is on presentation layer (front-end + logic).

🔧 Technologies:
Servlets – Handle HTTP requests/responses.

JSP (JavaServer Pages) – Embed Java code in HTML.

JSF (JavaServer Faces) – UI framework for Java web apps.

🧾 Example:
A simple online shopping website that lets users browse items, add to cart, and place orders.

🌐 2. What are Distributed Applications in Java EE?
Distributed Apps are applications where components run on multiple networked systems but work together as one.

✅ Key Features:
Built using EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans), JMS (Java Messaging Service), JAX-RS / JAX-WS.

Supports load balancing, scalability, and remote access.

Focus is on business logic, messaging, and remote method invocation.

🔧 Technologies:
EJB – Server-side components for business logic.

JMS – Messaging between distributed systems (asynchronous).

RMI, CORBA, Web Services – For communication across systems.

🧾 Example:
A banking system where:

Web app handles customer interactions,

Backend EJB handles transactions,

A remote service checks credit scores via SOAP/REST.

Java EE provides a modular and scalable framework to build:

Web apps (using Servlets, JSP, JSF)
REST/SOAP APIs (using JAX-RS, JAX-WS)
Backend business logic (using EJB, CDI)
Messaging systems (using JMS)
Database interactions (using JPA, JDBC)


======== JME  (Java Micro Edition )
it is installable s/w as mdk
 version =?
it  support embedded system and AI
